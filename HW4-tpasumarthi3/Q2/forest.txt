1) The main reason to use random forests over decision trees is because random forests generalize better whereas decision trees can be susceptible to over-fitting. The bootstrap aggregating process in Random Forests reduces variance by combining the results of various models built by randomly sampled subsets of the original data.
2) The entire random forest script runtime was: 88s
3) I was able to obtain an accuracy of 97.52%
